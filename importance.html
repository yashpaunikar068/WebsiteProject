        <h1>The Importance of Physical Fitness</h1>
        <p>
            To put it simply, physical activity and exercise is important for everyone. 
            Children, adolescents, and adults of all ages need regular physical activity. 
            Physical activity promotes good health, and you should stay active throughout 
            all stages of your life regardless of your body type or BMI.
            Understanding the benefits of physical fitness and knowing how active you should
            be can help you maintain good health and improve your overall quality of life. 
            Here are a few benefits of regular physical activity that demonstrate the importance 
            of physical fitness.

        </p>  
        <h3>Save money</h3>
        <p>
            According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases cause 
            7 out of 10 deaths in the U.S., and treating chronic diseases accounts for 86% of U.S. 
            healthcare costs. While some diseases cannot be prevented, you can reduce your risk for 
            certain disease – such as heart disease and diabetes – through reducing risky behaviors 
            and living a healthy lifestyle.
            Making healthy choices, such as engaging in regular physical activity, can reduce your 
            risk for many health issues and complications that can result in expensive medical care.
        </p>
        <h3>Increase your life expectancy</h3>
        <p>
            Numerous studies have shown that regular physical activity increases life expectancy and 
            reduces the risk of premature mortality. There’s not a magic formula that translates hours 
            of physical activity into hours of life gained, but research suggests that people who are 
            more active tend to be healthier and tend to live longer.
        </p>
        <h3>Reduce your risk of injury</h3>
        <p>
            Regular exercise and physical activity increase muscle strength, bone density, flexibility, 
            and stability. Physical fitness can reduce your risk for and resilience to accidental 
            injuries, especially as you get older. For example, stronger muscles and better balance mean 
            that you’re less likely to slip and fall, and stronger bones mean that your less likely to 
            suffer bone injuries should you take a tumble.

        </p>
        <h3>Improve your quality of life </h3>
        <p>
            A sedentary lifestyle and a lack of physical activity can take a toll on a person’s body. 
            Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, 
            numerous chronic diseases, and mental health issues. Exercise, however, has been shown to
             improve mood and mental health, and provides numerous health benefits. Of course physical 
             fitness also allows you to do things that you may not otherwise be able to do.
