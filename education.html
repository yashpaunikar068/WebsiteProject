        <h1>Physical education as a part of education</h1>
        <p>
            In institutionalized education, the main goal has been developing children's cognitive 
            capacity in the sense of learning knowledge in academic disciplines. This goal dictates 
            a learning environment in which seated learning behavior is considered appropriate and 
            effective and is rewarded. Physical education as part of education provides the only 
            opportunity for all children to learn about physical movement and engage in physical 
            activity. As noted, its goal and place in institutionalized education have changed 
            from the original focus on teaching hygiene and health to educating children about 
            the many forms and benefits of physical movement, including sports and exercise. 
            With a dramatic expansion of content beyond the original Swedish and German gymnastics 
            programs of the 19th century, physical education has evolved to become a content area with 
            diverse learning goals that facilitate the holistic development of children.

        <h3>Physical activity and mental health</h3>
        <p>
            Physical activity should be viewed as a continuum ranging from virtually no movement at all 
            (e.g., sedentary behaviour or sitting time) through light physical activity (e.g., light 
            ambulation) to moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity, MVPA (e.g., exercise, playing sports, 
            cycling to work). While it is often MVPA and “exercise” that are considered to be associated 
            with better mental health, we should not rule out the positive changes that can occur from 
            lower down the continuum. It is also important to note that people have widely varying 
            preferences for the types of activity they wish to engage in. Some of the mental health 
            benefits may be associated with doing something people “want to” and enjoy.
            The most widely studied area of physical activity and mental health is that concerning 
            depression. This has been researched as a transient sub‐clinical mood effect or in 
            populations with, or at risk of, clinical depression. For example, Dishman et al5 reported 
            20‐33% lower odds of depression for active groups in prospective cohort studies.
