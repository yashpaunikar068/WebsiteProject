            <h1>PHYSICAL WELLBEING AND HEALTHY HABITS</h1>
            <p>
                Physical well-being consists of the ability to perform physical activities 
                and carry out social roles that are not hindered by physical limitations 
                and experiences of bodily pain, and biological health indicators.

            Making the right choices for health and well-being can be challenging.
            Although we know what is good for us and how we can do and be better, 
            we may not act on it, or if we do, we may, in due course, slide back to familiar ways. 
            Human behavior what we do, how we do it, and whether we will succeed is influenced 
            by many factors, 2 of which are of particular relevance when it comes to wellness: 
            self-regulation and habits.
        </p>  
        <h3>Self Regulation</h3>
        <p>
            Self-regulation is central to effective human functioning. It is “our ability
             to direct our behavior and control our impulses so that we meet certain standards, 
             achieve certain goals, or reach certain ideals”. It allows us to act in our short- 
             and long-term best interests, consistent with our deepest values. There’s just one 
             limitation:self-regulation requires mental energy,and the brain is always looking 
             for ways to conserve energy.
        </p>
        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>
            Habits, in contrast, require very little energy. As Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit: 
            Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business says, “Any behavior that can be reduced to a routine
            is one less behavior that we must spend time and energy consciously thinking about and deciding 
            upon”. With the cognitive economy and performance efficiency of 
            habits, the brain can conserve self-regulatory strength to focus on the important decisions 
            in life, and free us to 
            engage in thoughtful activities, such as reflecting on the past and planning for the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Self Awareness</h3>
        <p>
            Change becomes much more achievable if you pay attention to who you are and insert 
            routines that take advantage of your strengths, tendencies, and aptitudes. 
            With self-awareness, you can cultivate the habits that work for you. Consider, 
            for instance, differences in circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms reflect our 
            natural tendencies for sleeping and waking and influence our energy and productivity 
            at different times in the day. The odds of success to improve your fitness won’t 
            increase if, for example, you decide to rise an hour earlier to exercise each day when 
            you happen to be a “night owl” rather than “morning lark.” Self-awareness includes 
            knowledge about other aspects of self as well, such as whether you are a marathoner, 
            sprinter, or procrastinator; under- or over-buyer; simplicity or abundance lover; 
            finisher or opener; and familiarity or novelty lover. It also includes whether 
            you are promotion- or prevention-focused, and whether you like taking small or big 
            steps.
